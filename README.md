# TicTacToe.Game
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players alternate turns to mark spaces in a 3x3 grid.
One player uses the symbol 'X' and the other uses 'O'.
The goal is to be the first to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The game begins with an empty grid, and players decide who will be 'X' and who will be 'O'.
Players take turns to place their symbol in an empty cell of the grid.
Player 'O' typically goes first, followed by Player 'x'.
Winner: If a player successfully aligns three of their marks, they are declared the winner.
Tie: If all squares are filled without a winning line, the game ends in a tie.
A "Restart" button is available to reset the game, clearing the grid and allowing a new game to start immediately.
